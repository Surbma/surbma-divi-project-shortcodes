Shortcodes to display Divi's Project elements, like category and tag list.

== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to build a Project page with Divi's own Page Builder, but want to show the Project categories or tags? There is no option to do it in Divi, but with Surbma - Divi Project Shortcodes plugin, you can display them anywhere.

Even you have the option to display the original Project title area and/or the original meta box for Skills and Project date, as they are appearing in normal Project pages. Wow!

= Show Project category list =

With this shortcode you can display a list of all categories assigned to the current Project. Categories are separated with commas and all are linked to their respective category listing pages.

**The shortcode:**
`[project-category-list]`

= Show Project tag list =

With this shortcode you can display a list of all tags assigned to the current Project. Tags are separated with commas and all are linked to their respective tag listing pages.

**The shortcode:**
`[project-tag-list]`

= Show original Project title with category list =

With this shortcode you can display the original title format, that you see on normal Project pages without Page Builder. The title will be in a H1 tag and the categories will be listed next to it.

**The shortcode:**
`[project-title]`

= Show original Project meta box with tags and date =

With this shortcode you can display the original meta box for tags and date, that you can see on normal Project pages without Page Builder.

**The shortcode:**
`[project-meta-box]`

IMPORTANT! This (or any other) shortcode is working only in a widget, if you or the theme has enabled the use of shortcodes in widgets. I'm not giving any description how you can do it, because there are a lot of posts out there. You can do a search for this: wordpress enable shortcodes in widgets

You have to buy the Divi Theme to use this plugin:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't work the shortcode in a text widget? =

Because you have to enable this function. By default, Wordpress does not allow you to use shortcodes in widgets. I'm not giving any description how you can do it, because there are a lot of posts out there. You can do a search for this: wordpress enable shortcodes in widgets

= What does Surbma mean? =

It is the reverse version of my last name. ;)
